<h1>PTIK FKIP UNS</h1>

<p id="paragraf1">
    <span>Sebelas Maret University</span>, Surakarta is an <span>Educational Personnel Education Institution (LPTK)</span> which has 24 study programs in 6 majors. Each study program has its own characteristics in producing <span>superior, strong and intelligent educational staff</span>.
</p>

<p id="paragraf2">
    The <span>Informatics and Computer Technology Education (PTIK)</span> study program is planned to take shelter in the management of the <span>Engineering and Vocational Education (PTK)</span> department. This placement revises our previous statement, where the PTIK study program is under the P.MIPA department. PTIK is a study program that will produce graduates who are <span>specialized in recent in vocational programs</span>. So, it would be better if PTIK was under the PTK department, specifically in the <span>Mechanical Engineering Education</span>. To meet the needs of lecturers in the field of information technology that cannot be met by the PTK department, PTIK will conduct <span>resource sharing with the mathematics study program</span>.
