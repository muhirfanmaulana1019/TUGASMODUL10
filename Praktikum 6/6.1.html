    <p id="paragraf">
        The <span class="highlightable">Faculty of Teacher Training and Education, Sebelas Maret University</span>, 
        Surakarta is an <span class="highlightable">Educational Personnel Education Institution (LPTK)</span> 
        which has 24 study programs in 6 majors. Each study program has its own characteristics in producing <span 
        class="highlightable">superior, strong and intelligent educational staff</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <span class="highlightable">Informatics and Computer Technology Education (PTIK)</span> 
        study program is planned to take shelter in the management of the <span class="highlightable">
        Engineering and Vocational Education (PTK)</span> department. 
        This placement revises our previous statement, where the PTIK study program is under the P.MIPA department.
        PTIK is a study program that will produce graduates who are <span class="highlightable">prioritized to teach in vocational/vocational schools</span>. 
        So, it would be better if PTIK was under the PTK department which oversees vocational programs such as <span class="highlightable">Building Engineering Education</span>, 
        and <span class="highlightable">Mechanical Engineering Education</span>. To meet the needs of lecturers in the field of information technology that cannot be met by the PTK department, 
        PTIK will conduct <span class="highlightable">resource sharing with the mathematics study program</span>.
